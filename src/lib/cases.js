    story: `Emeka is a 34-year-old father of three who works as a mechanic. He began experiencing a persistent cough and severe weight loss three months ago but delayed testing due to financial constraints.

When he finally collapsed at work, he was rushed to our partner clinic where he tested positive for Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The diagnosis was devastating for his family, as he is the sole breadwinner and could no longer work due to fatigue and the risk of infecting his children.

**Current Situation:**
Emeka has started the 6-month DOTS regimen. He is currently in the *Intensive Phase*, taking daily medication under supervision. However, the side effects and his inability to work mean his family is struggling to eat.

**Medical Needs:**
- Daily DOTS medication monitoring.
- Monthly liver function tests to check for drug toxicity.
- Nutritional support (high-protein diet) to tolerate the strong antibiotics.

Your donation will cover his transport to the clinic, essential food packs for his family, and the supplementary medications needed to manage side effects, ensuring he completes the full course and returns to health.`,

    stage: "Recovery Phase",
    story: `Fatima, a 28-year-old seamstress, was diagnosed with TB of the lymph nodes after noticing painful swellings in her neck. While the medication is free, the toll it takes on the body is immense.

TB medication requires a strong immune system and a full stomach to be effective. Malnutrition is one of the biggest reasons treatment fails, leading to relapse or drug resistance. Fatima lives in a rural community where access to protein-rich food is limited and expensive.

**Why Nutrition Matters:**
Without adequate protein, Fatima's body cannot repair the tissue damage caused by the bacteria. She has already lost 8kg since her diagnosis and suffering from severe nausea.

**The Intervention:**
We are providing Fatima with a weekly nutrient pack containing:
- Eggs and Milk
- Beans and Soy
- Multivitamins

This simple intervention significantly boosts cure rates and helps patients like Fatima regain their strength and independence faster.`,

    story: `Tuberculosis thrives in crowded, poorly ventilated areas. The Makoko community, with its high population density, is a hotspot for undetected TB cases.

Many residents have had a cough for weeks but assume it is just a common cold or "smoker's cough." By the time they seek help, they may have already infected 10-15 other people, including their own children.

**Our Strategy:**
Arowolo Health Foundation is deploying a Mobile Screening Unit to Makoko for a 3-day health drive. 
- **Step 1:** Community volunteers raise awareness and identify symptomatic individuals.
- **Step 2:** On-site digital Chest X-rays using AI-assisted detection.
- **Step 3:** Sputum samples collected for GeneXpert testing.
- **Step 4:** Immediate enrollment into treatment for positive cases.

Your support funds the logistics, the medical team, and the testing kits needed to screen over 500 people in just one weekend.`,

    story: `Chinedu is only 5 years old. He contracted TB from a neighbor who was unaware of their status. Pediatric TB is notoriously difficult to diagnose because children cannot produce sputum samples easily.

After weeks of unexplained fever and weight loss, Chinedu was finally diagnosed using advanced stool testing methods. He is weak but fighting hard.

**The Challenge:**
Children need child-friendly, dispersible tb medicines that taste better and are easier to swallow than bitter adult pills. They also require closer monitoring to prevent developmental delays.

**Your Impact:**
Donating to this fund ensures Chinedu gets:
1. Pediatric-formulated anti-TB drugs.
2. Nutritional supplements to aid growth catch-up.
3. Toys and educational materials to keep him engaged during long hospital visits.

Saving a child from TB gives them their entire future back.`,

    story: `Grace is a teacher who loves her students. Recently, she was flagged for potential Drug-Resistant TB (DR-TB), a more severe form of the disease that does not respond to standard drugs.

While waiting for confirmation and treatment initiation, Grace must isolate to protect her husband and three children in their small one-bedroom apartment. This is physically impossible without external help.

**The Solution:**
We are raising funds to rent a temporary self-contained room for Grace for 2 months. This "Isolation Support" provides:
- A safe, ventilated space for her to recover without guilt or fear.
- Daily food delivery so she doesn't need to cook or go out.
- Hygiene kits (masks, disinfectants) to maintain a sterile environment.

Helping Grace isolate is not just charitable; it is a public health necessity to stop the spread of DR-TB.`,

- **Training:** Equipping local health workers with knowledge to spot TB early.
- **Advocacy:** Fighting for policy changes and lower drug prices.
- **Stigma Reduction:** Educational radio jingles and community theater to stop the shaming of TB patients.
